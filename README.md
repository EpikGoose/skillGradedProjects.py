When I restarted learning Python, I wanted to learn it in a special way, not in a memorize and throw-away format.
As I began searching for this special way, I stumbled upon a list called "Skill Graded Projects" which was created by  a user @desrtfx (huge shoutout to you man <3) and the list gave you a group of projects to complete for
every language mechanic that you learned.
I was fascinated by this fun way of learning Python by building a humble mini-project portfolio.
With this fun idea in mind, I created this repository to upload my work and progress through the list to feel as if I truly pushed the boundaries of the info that I learned in Python, and to improve my problem-solving skills.
